# AwesomeMovie.com
Developed a movie listing site, which would list movies of different genres along with a short description.
The movies can also be filtered based on the genre and the movie director depending on the users        
preference.(NOTE: The project file index.html runs only on Mozilla Firefox)

How to run the application: Go to the AwesomeMovie.com folder -> Open the index.html file
